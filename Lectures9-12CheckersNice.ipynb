    "Checkers is typically played on the same 8x8 board as chess. In order to play the game, we are going to have to store the state of the game, i.e. the contents of each square, in memory. A natural representation of the board is a matrix, where every element corresponds to a square on the board. We choose a convention that the square is empty when corresponding matrix element is 0, and 1 or 2 when there is piece from player 1 or 2, respectively, in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may choose to change this convention later, so instead of \"hard-wiring\" 0, 1, and 2 into our code, we'll use variables that store the index. Using a variable will also make our code more readable. Similarily, we will keep our size flexible."

    "# Write a function to handle player moves\n",
    "We note that checkers is a simple game where each (non-king) piece moves forward and to the left or right. So we can specify a move by choosing a piece and picking left or right. A move is simply taking a piece at location `x,y` to a location `x+x_offset,y+y_offset`, where the offsets depend on the player and the choosen direction. So the first step in making a moving a piece is to determine what is the appropriate offset for given the color (aka player number) and the direction of intended move (right or left).\n",
    "\n",
    "This `moves` dictionary is an elegant and flexible solution to do this. We can change the definitions of `player_1`, `player_2`, `right_move`, and `left_move` without having to change the definition of `moves`. The message to walk away from this small discussion is that there sometimes are various ways to represent logic. In this case as a function, list of lists, or dictionary of dictionaries. And some provide more flexibility and/or are more elegant than others."
